<p>The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. 
    Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in The Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. 
    Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, 
    and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, 
    welcomed a fourteenth to fill in to their party.</p>

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth,
                 he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, 
                he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. 
                He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, 
                and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield,
                " which would remain with him even in death.</p>

            <p>Fíli and Kíli were brothers, the youngest of the thirteen dwarves who set out on Thorin Oakenshield's
                 quest along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins to reclaim the Lonely Mountain for the Dwarves.
                Fíli and Kíli were the two most active dwarves of Thorin's company, and apart from Balin, and possibly Bombur,
                 they appeared more frequently
                as "individual" characters in Tolkien's novel than the rest of Thorin's companions, who were most 
                often named only in "group" references to the entire company.</p>

                <p>Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, 
                    and uncle of Gimli. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, 
                    and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain.
                     Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company. 
                    He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely 
                    Mountain along with many other dwarves of The Company of Thorin.</p>

                    <p>In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the
                        Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. In TA 2941, Glóin and his brother Óin, 
                        along with his cousins Dwalin and Balin, were among the Dwarves accompanying Thorin and Company during their quest to the Lonely Mountain to recapture it from the Dragon Smaug. 
                        He was noted for his skills with a tinderbox, 
                        and, along with his brother Óin, was usually the one told to get a fire started whenever the Dwarves made camp. Gloin also fought in the Battle of the Five Armies.
                        After the battle, he settled in the Lonely Mountain.</p>

                    <p>Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. 
                        He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.
                        A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest friends and advisors. 
                        Balin is distantly related to Thorin, and is a descendant of the noble house of Durin.
                        He later went to re-establish the greatest kingdom of the Dwarves, Khazad-Dûm (at this point in time named Moria),
                         but within five years it was overcome once more by Orcs, and he was killed there.</p>

                        <p>Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin,
                             and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left the 
                             Ered Luin to visit Erebor. The small party was dogged
                              by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845, 
                              Thráin was captured one night when he and his

                              black rain. After a fruitless search for their leader, 
                              the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him

                        <h3>Dori</h3>
                        <p>Dori was a Dwarf of Durin's Folk, who along with his brothers Nori and Ori travelled with Bilbo Baggins and Thorin 
                            Oakenshield as a member of Thorin's Company on the Quest for Erebor to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the Dragon Smaug.
                            Dori was among the Dwarves at Bag End who joined in singing about "blunting the knives" and "bending the forks"; as well 
                            as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described as “decent fellow despite his grumbling”. 
                            He often wore a red-violet coat while on The Quest for Erebor.
                            In the book and films Dori is a supporting character,
                             but in the Rankin/Bass version he is a minor character.
                              In the films he is mainly in the background. 
                              Though he is a secondary character he is on screen more than his brothers 
                              Nori, and Ori.</p>

                                and was a remote kinsman of Thorin Oakenshield. His hood was purple,
                                layed the flute, and he was very fond of regular and plentiful meals 
                                like his hobbit friend,

                        <p>Bombur's parentage is unknown; 
                            the only familial connections mentioned are his brother Bofur
                             and his cousin Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line although
                              he was descended from Dwarves of Moria. His birth year is also
                               unknown, however, from Bilbo Baggins' account from the quest 
                               to Erebor it is known that the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the 
                               youngest of the 13 "by some fifty years" and that after Thorin
                                had been captured, Balin was "the eldest left". Since Fíli was
                                 born in TA 2859 and Balin was born in TA 2763, this would put 
                                 Bombur's birth between 2763 and 2809, and he would have been
                                  between 132 and 178 years old during the quest to Erebor. 
                                  Prior to the quest Bombur probably lived in the Blue Mountains
                                    with Thorin after the loss of Thráin II.</p>

                                At first, Olórin was nervous and 
                                described himself as too weak and too
                                 afraid of Sauron. Manwë understood, and 
                                 told him that that was one main reason why
                                  he should go, to overcome that fear. Thus,
                                   he insisted that Olórin should go as the third,
                                    but Varda convinced him not to include Olórin
                                     as the third, but as the second. Olórin
                                      agreed, and prepared for his departure from
                                       the Undying Lands with the other four wizards.</p>
